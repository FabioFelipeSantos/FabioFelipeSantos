# Hi GitHub Community

My name is FÃ¡bio, and I'm a Mathematician from Brazil. :penguin: 

I've taught math at university since 2008 and meanwhile, in my free time, I am working with structural analysis (it's a wonderful hobby; you have to try :grinning:)

Because my passion about structural analysis I have always had a huge contact with programming. I've started learning some languages and how to code, about 2010/2011. Until now, I have some experience with the following languages:
- C (was awesome to learn; I feel miss study with [Deitel Book](https://pictures.abebooks.com/isbn/9780131426443-us.jpg))
- C++ (maybe my preferred language until I discover Python :snake: and my introduction to OOP)
- MatLab (ok, it's not a language, but you have to learn some tricks with C++ to use it). This has been my longest friend. I use him for almost everything, but mainly for structural analysis and optimization.
- :snake: **Python** :snake: (just EPIC, miss words to explain how beautiful and wonderful he is). With Python, I worked with so many libraries that I am not capable of counting.
- FORTRAN (this language I have the aim to forget, but I don't know; I suffered in his hands for so long that my life was scarred). And to worsen the situation, I worked with the F95 with 72 columns at maximum (was a dark time)

Now, because of a health problem, I have to change my career, and I decided to continue with my self-journey in learning code. I decided to become a FullStack developer (fingers crossed). So, I'm currently learning the basic roadmap:
- The divine trio HTML, CSS, and JavaScript;
- React;
- Database;
- Frameworks;
- And things that I forgot now...

So, now I'm looking to collaborate on any project that my skills can help with, and some tips or tricks for learning will help too. In this way, feel free to send me a message. It will be a pleasure to change knowledge.

For now, it's all... Bye!!!
